### Requirements
---

* Make domain models for
    * `Category` with `id` and `name`.
        * A `Category` can have many `Products`.
    * `Product` with `id, name, price` and `rating`.
        * A `Product` can belong to only one `Category`.
    * `User` with `id, email, password, firstName, lastname`.
        * `User` can create many `Reviews`.
        * `User` can have only one `Address`.
    * `Address` with `id, street, zip` and `city`.
        * An `Address` can belong to only one `User`.
    * `Review` with `id, comment`.
        * A `Review` can only belong to one `User`.
* Create entity relationship mappings as follows: (Creating a package for each requirement is advised.)
    * Create them using `uni-directional`.
    * Create them using `bi-directional`.
    * Create `User` and `Review` mapping with  `Join Table`.
    * Create `User` and `Review` mapping with  `Join Column`.
    * Create `User` and `Address` mapping with  `Join Table`.
    * Create `User` and `Address` mapping with  `Join Column`.

* Implement CRUD operations and build REST API for all domain models.

* Implement the following queries by using `Naming Convention` and `JPQL`. Create REST endpoints for them.
    * Find all products that cost more than `minPrice`.
    * Find all products in `cat` category and cost less than `maxPrice`.
    * Find all products that contain `keyword` in the name.
    * Find reviews of the product whose id is `id`.

### Technical Details
---

* Use n-tier software architecture model.
* Use DTOs.
* PostgreSQL is recommended as a Relational Database system.
* Populate your database with dummy data using `data.sql`.

## Submission

* Create a postman collection that includes sample requests for all of your endpoints.
* Fork the repository and push your changes.
* Once you finished your project, send a Pull Request. (Send only one Pull Request once you finish the assignment.)

### Important Notes
---

* You are not allowed to share codes with your classmates. If detected, you will get NC.
* **For pairs:**
    * Individual's work will be checked from the commits.
    * Share tasks evenly and fairly.
    * To have a clearer understanding of pair programming:
        *  > **Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the _driver_, writes code while the other, the _observer_ or _navigator_ reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
        * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#:~:text=Pair%20programming%20is%20an%20agile,two%20programmers%20switch%20roles%20frequently.)

- Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s
  own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden.

- Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every
  professor.
